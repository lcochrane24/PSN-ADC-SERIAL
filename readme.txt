This folder contains the files needed to build the 16-Bit 8 Channel PSN-ADC-SERIAL Analog to digital board. 
See https://www.seismicnet.com/serialatod.html for more information.
I am making this information available since they are no longer for sells.
This is what is in each of the sub-folders:

BOM - The file dspsdr_bom.txt is the bill of materials (parts list) for the board.

gerber - Gerber files to make the PCB. The board is 2 layers.

html - This is a copy of the PSN-ADC-SERIAL files on my web site https://www.seismicnet.com

schematic - Schematics of the board.

src - Firmware source code files.

Please do not contact me directly regarding building this board. For support please use the PSNList Google group at https://groups.google.com/g/psnlist

Thanks,
Larry Cochrane
