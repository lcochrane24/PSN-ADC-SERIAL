This folder contains the schematic of my 16-Bit 8 Channel Serial Output Analog to Digital Converter board.
See https://www.seismicnet.com/serialatod.html for more information.
The only difference between the 2 boards is the input connector.
File dsdrdb25.pdf is for the ADC board with the DB25 connector. 
File dsdradc.pdf is for the ADC board with the 26-pin header.
